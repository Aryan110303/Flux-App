# ⚡️ Flux — MVP Energy. Wallet Therapy.

Welcome to **Flux**, the app that pretends to fix your finances — and *kinda* does.  
It’s an MVP (*Minimal Viable Product*, not *Most Valuable Player*... yet), built with love, late nights, and the hope that someone out there will fund this.

## 💡 What Even Is Flux?

Flux is your friendly, budget-tracking sidekick that helps you figure out where your money is going (spoiler: it’s food, subscriptions, and emotional spending).

Right now, it can:

- 💰 Track your **income**
- 🧾 Record your **expenses**
- 📊 Show you how much you’ve “saved” (even if it’s ₹42. Nice.)
- 📚 Offer **investment options** like SIPs, FDs, mutual funds, and more (explained like you’re 5)
- 🧠 Includes a **barebones SmartAI** (don't get excited — it answers simple finance questions. That’s it. It’s learning, okay?)

Coming *hopefully soon-ish*:

- 💳 **UPI payments** directly from Flux — no more typing your chai expenses manually  
- 💸 Automatic expense detection (because manual effort is so 2010)
- 📲 Notifications that gently yell at you when you overspend

## 🌀 4-Step Master Plan

Because even MVPs need structure.

1. **Add Salary** – Fake it till you make it.
2. **Add Expenses** – Be honest, we know you bought that 8th tote bag.
3. **Get Savings** – Reality check, served cold.
4. **View Investment Options** – Because stuffing cash in a drawer isn’t a plan.

## 🤔 But Is That It?

Well yeah, **Sherlock**, what did you expect from an MVP?  
A full-blown finance advisor with neural networks and crypto prediction?  
Flux is still growing — and when someone decides to throw money at this idea, you’ll see it evolve into something way cooler.

Until then… it’s minimalist. Let’s call it **financial minimalism**.
